Throws a spectral copy of your shield as a projectile which cannot pierce, and deals off-hand damage augmented by the evasion of the shield. When it collides with something it will shatter, launching a number of smaller shards as projectiles in all directions. Modifiers that cause additional projectiles to be fired will add more shards, not more copies of the shield.
